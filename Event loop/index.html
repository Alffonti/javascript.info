    <h1>Event loop</h1>
    <p>
      JavaScript operates as a <mark>single-threaded</mark> language (only one
      line of code is executed at a time). To prevent unresponsiveness in web
      pages, JavaScript employs an <mark>event loop</mark> mechanism. This
      mechanism enables the execution of lengthy operations to occur
      independently from the <mark>main execution thread</mark>.
    </p>
    <div class="note">
      <p>
        The browser run an iteration of the event loop in the following order:
      </p>
      <ol>
        <li>Choose a task to execute from the task queue</li>
        <li>Execute the chosen task</li>
        <li>Perform microtask checkpoint (execute all available microtasks)</li>
        <li>Update the rendering if needed.</li>
        <li>Repeat the process</li>
      </ol>
    </div>
    <p>
      Within the event loop, the main execution thread begins by executing the
      main script (which is considered the first task). Whenever a function or
      code block is invoked, a new <mark>execution context</mark> is created and
      placed onto a call stack within the main thread. This
      <mark>call stack</mark>
      effectively maintains a record of previously called functions. The code
      within a function is executed within this newly created context. As soon
      as the code exits that context, the corresponding execution context is
      deleted.
    </p>
    <p>
      Once the main thread is empty (all functions within the call stack have
      been executed), all <mark>microtasks</mark> are executed. Microtasks
      include promise resolutions, <code>queueMicrotask()</code> and
      <code>process.nextTick()</code>. When these functions are invoked (unlike
      regular functions that are added to the call stack), its callback
      functions are added to the <mark>microtask queue</mark>. This separate
      microtask queue ensures that microtasks are executed independently from
      the main thread, thus preventing any obstruction.
    </p>
    <p>
      Once all microtasks have been executed,
      <b
        >the browser render the page (or rerender the updated nodes) if there
        are DOM updates</b
      >.
    </p>
    <p>
      A new cycle of the event loop is initiated by adding the oldest pending
      task in the task queue to the main thread.
      <mark>Tasks</mark> (macrotasks) inlcude timeouts, intervals, and DOM
      events. When these functions are invoked or a DOM event is triggered
      (unlike regular functions that are added to the call stack), its callback
      functions are added to the task queue.
    </p>
    <div class="note">
      The browser's event loop processes macrotasks in the order they were added
      to the queue, but it only executes a macrotask's associated callback if
      the specified time has elapsed (for tasks scheduled using
      <code>setTimeout</code> or <code>setInterval</code>).
    </div>
    <div class="note">
      The minimum time required for rendering is 16.67 milliseconds. This
      implies that multiple tasks can be executed if each task takes less than
      this duration.
    </div>
    <p>
      Macrotasks and microtasks are essential for
      <mark>asynchronous operations</mark> in JavaScript. While they are both
      executed outside of the main thread, they have different priorities and
      execution order. Microtasks, being higher-priority, allow developers to
      perform tasks like managing state updates, ensuring smoother user
      experiences even during long-running tasks. Macrotasks, on the other hand,
      deal with events and timers that are less time-critical.

    <div class="example">
      <h2>
        Microtasks execution
        <button id="loadScriptButton2">Play example</button>
      </h2>
      <p id="text">Initial (please wait 2s)</p>

      <script>
        document
          .getElementById('loadScriptButton2')
          .addEventListener('click', function () {
            requestAnimationFrame(() => {
              document.getElementById('text').textContent =
                'modified (The function "lockUI" engages in recursive promise chaining over a span of 5 seconds. All these promises will get executed before the next rendering, and block the rendering process (page is unresponsive).'
              const start = performance.now()
              ;(function lockUI() {
                // IIFE
                if (performance.now() - start < 2000) {
                  return Promise.resolve().then(lockUI)
                }
              })()
            })
          })
      </script>
    </div>

    <div class="example">
      <h2>Execution of microtasks within multiple scripts</h2>
      <p id="text2">
        Microtasks are promptly executed immediately after the script finishes
        its execution (typically when the closing script tag is encountered). In
        scenarios involving multiple script tags, the browser processes and
        executes each script independently. This leads to the completion of the
        entire execution of the first script, including its microtasks, before
        transitioning to the subsequent script. (In this example, the console
        logs 2,1,3).
      </p>
      <script>
        new Promise(r => r()).then(() => {
          console.log(1)
        })
        console.log(2)
      </script>
      <script>
        console.log(3)
      </script>
    </div>

    <div class="note">
      <p>
        The requestAnimationFrame() callbacks are executed right after the main
        script and all microtasks have run, but just before the browser performs
        the next rendering update. This ensures that your animations or other
        visual changes are applied at the right time, just before the rendering
        repaint occurs.
